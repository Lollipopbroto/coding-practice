# coding-practice
This is where I will store the projects I create for practicing and enforcing my coding ability.

Projects here will either be:
 - something I think will help my coding skill, or
 - something I am interested in making

If possible (and depending on size) I'll try to make a version of the project in all the base languages I both know at the time and consider relevant to the project.
